            <h1>Star Shopping Letra</h1>  
            <p>--------</p>
            <p>Wait right here
                <p>I'll be back in the morning
                I know that I'm not that important to you
                But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
                So much more than perfect
                Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
                If you give me time, I could work on it
                Give me some time while I work on it</p>

                <p>Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
                The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me
                Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
                'Cause we only have one conversation a week
                That's why your friends always hatin' on me
                Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
                Matter of fact, I ain't ever asked no one for help
                And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings</p>

                <p>None of my exes is over Lil Peep
                Nobody flexin' as much as I be
                That's why she text me and tell me she love me
                She know that someday I'll be over the sea
                Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
                I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
                Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me</p>

                <p>I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be
                If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
                Look at my face while you talkin' to me
                'Cause we only have one conversation a week
                Can I get one conversation at least?
                Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
                This music's the only thing keeping
                The peace when I'm fallin' to pieces</p>

                <p>Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
                A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
                Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason</p>
